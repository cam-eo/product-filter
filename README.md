# Product filtering example

NextJS

## Comments from Cam

Really not my best work. I haven't had much spare time to work on this :(

This whole thing is really nasty but it's the best I could build with the time I have at the moment. The pagination partly works, and the filter partly works. The filter has not been factored into the pagination just yet.
